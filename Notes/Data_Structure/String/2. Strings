Strings: Strings in Java are handled with the String reference type. The language does
make it appear that the String type is a primitive type because it provides the +
and += operators for concatenation. However, this is the only reference type
for which any operator overloading is allowed. Otherwise, the String behaves
like any other reference type.



String Operations:

1. Concatnation: Using + operator datleast one string operand we can concat with other string

ex: abc" + 5 // abc5

2. Strings Comparigs :  for comparing two strings in string class special method 
.equal is available that will comapre strings that store identical values.

ex: first.equal(First)

3. Accessing Value in String: 
a. .length method: it help to find the total length of string.
b .charAt[index]: it help to find charector at given index.
c. substring.: This method help to convert one string to many substring, 
using 
ex: string.substring[from, till]
