Polymorphism: Here we develop a feature such that it can take more than 
one form depending on the situation.


Types of Polymorphism.
1. Method Overriding
2. Method Overloading
____________________________________________________________________________________
1. Method Overriding: 
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, 
it is known as method overriding in Java.

In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has 
been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.
____________________________________________________________________________________
Usage of Java Method Overriding
Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already 
provided by its superclass.
Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

____________________________________________________________________________________
Rules for Java Method Overriding
1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).




You can use @Override anotation 
to prevernt error during Overloading.

Note: during Overriding we can increase the scope of method & override in child class but we 
can not reduce the scope of method in child class during Overriding a
_____________________________________________________________________________
package A;                                  | package A;
                                            |
public class B implements A{                |public interface A{
    public void test(){
        System.out.println(1)
    }                                       |     public void test();   
    public static void main(String[] args){
        B b1 = new B();
        b1.test();
    }

}                                           |}

When a class implements an interface then the class has to override the incomplete method of interface that or else
will get error as shown  in example
_____________________________________________________________________________
package A;                                  | package A;
                                            |
public class B implements A{                |public interface A{
                                            |     public void test();   
}                                           |}
