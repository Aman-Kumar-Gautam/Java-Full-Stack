1. Fuctional interface:
-------------------- 
A functional interface should consist of exactly one incompleate method Intermidiate
Note : In functional interface incompleate method can be one,
but complete method can be any number.

Question : Can we do multiple interfaces on functional interfaces. ?

Ans: Yes 

2. Default keyword :
---------------------
default keyword was introduced in version 8 of java ,
using default keyword we can create complete method inside interface.

3. Inside interface we can create main method.

4. Static complete method: that's means we can create Static method also complete.

Note: Because we can write main method in interface, so we can run also interface as well.
