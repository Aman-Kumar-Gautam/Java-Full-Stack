The Switch Statement:
The switch statement is used to select among several small integer (or character)
values. The switch statement is used to select among several small integer 
(or character) values. It consists of an expression and a block. The block 
contains a sequence of statements and a collection of labels, which represent 
possible values of the expression. All the labels must be distinct compile-time 
constants. 
An optional default label, if present, matches any unrepresented label. If there is no applicable case for the switch expression, the switch statement is over; otherwise, control
passes to the appropriate label and all statements from that point on are executed.
A break statement may be used to force early termination of the switch and is
almost always used to separate logically distinct cases.
