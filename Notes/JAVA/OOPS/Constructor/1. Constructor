Topic: Constructor, Types of constructor.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an 
instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is 
allocated in the memory.

It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such 
case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

There are two types of constructors in Java: 
1. no-arg constructor, and 
2. parameterized constructor.

Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation. 
It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because java compiler creates 
a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.

Rules for creating Java constructor
There are two rules defined for the constructor.

Constructor name must be the same as its class name
A Constructor must have no explicit return type
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized


1. Java Default Constructor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
If we do not add constructor then during compilation automatically empty body no args 
constructor gets added in .class file.


Note: 
1. Default constructor is not applicable for object with argument
2. If in the same program object with and without argument is created then default
constructor is not applicable.

2. Java Parameterized Constructor
A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.

Why use the parameterized constructor?
The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.

Example of parameterized constructor
In this example, we have created the constructor of Student class that have two parameters. We can have any number of parameters in the constructor.

//Java Program to demonstrate the use of the parameterized constructor.  
class Student4{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    //creating a parameterized constructor  
    Student4(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    //method to display the values  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    //creating objects and passing values  
    Student4 s1 = new Student4(111,"Karan");  
    Student4 s2 = new Student4(222,"Aryan");  
    //calling method to display the values of object  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
}
