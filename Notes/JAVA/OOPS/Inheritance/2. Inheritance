Inheritance: Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties 
and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming 
system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon 
existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields 
of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

Note:
1. Here we inherit the member of parent class to child class so that we 
can reuse that in child class.

Multiple Inheritance: Java dpes not support multiple inheritance at class level but 
Interfaces support multiple inheritance


Multi-level Inheritance: 



The diamond problem is a term used in programming, specifically in the context of object-
oriented languages like Java, to describe an ambiguity that arises when a class inherit
from two classes that have a common ancestor.
