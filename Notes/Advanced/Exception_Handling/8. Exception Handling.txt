Exception Handling: To handle exception in jva we use try catch block. if any
exception occurs in try block then try block will create exception object and that object
address is given to catch block.


Catch block will handle that exception and hence further program will run continue.


Types of Exception
1. Checked exception(Compile time exception)
2. Un-checked exception (Run time exception)


1. Checked exception(Compile time exception): If an exception occurs when .java
file is converted to .class file it is called as Checked exception(Compile time exception)


In other words these exception occurs during Compilation phase of your project.


2. Un-checked exception (Run time exception): If an exception occurs when you run .class file 
it is called as Un-Checked exception(run time exception)


In other words these exception occurs during Run time phase of your project.
